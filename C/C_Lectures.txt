CPU Definition

Memory Types - RAM/ROM

CPU Instructions

Types of programs
	- System Programs
	- Application Programs

Programming Langugaes
=> Low level
	- Assembly / OP codes
	- Machine language/ Machine code/ Binary

=> High Level (Provide abstraction from machine level languages)
	- Compiled 
		ex: C, C++, Java...
	- Interpreted 
		ex: Python, Javascript...

Compilation Process
	
	Test.c --> C Compiler --> Executable file 

C Compilers examples: 
	- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
	- Clang
	- MSVC / Microsoft Visual C++ 
	- ICC / Intel C Compiler

Interpretation Process

	Source code --> Interpreter --> O/P within the Interpreter software itself

Why Linux
=========

	- Open Source
	- Light Weight
	- More Secure
	- Easy to Cross Compile
	- Used Everywhere ex: IOT, Android, Medical Instruments, Home Applicances etc..

cdac@cdac-vm:-$

In the above linux terminal text 

	cdac 		--> Username
	cdac-vm		--> Host Machine Name
	$			--> Denotes Normal User (Not root)

Windows - Folders
Linux 	- Directories

Blue  - directories
White - files
Green - executables

Linux Commands
==============

ls - list // Lists the contents in the current Directory

pwd - Print Working Direcory // Displays the absolute path of the present working directory 
*Absolute means path starting from the root directory

mkdir - Make Directory

cd - change directory

cd .. 	// changes to the previous directory

cd / 	// changes directory to root 

rmdir // remove directory
* Doesn't work on non-empty directories

rmdir -r // to remove the directory along with it's contents
* -rf forces deletion without confirmation

man [linux_command] // displays the man page 

vi // opens vi editor

vi test.c // creates test.c file and also opens the vi editor 

	=> to work with vi editor

	1) Press i to enter into 'insert mode'/ edit mode
	2) Write the contents
	3) Press esc to enter into the 'command mode'
	4) type in wq and press enter to save the file and exit the vi editor

cat - concatenate // used to display the contents of a file - entire

similar to cat - more, less, head, tail

ctrl + l // clears the terminal screen

ls -l // list in long listing format

ls -al // displays hidden files too

Linux permissions
=================

-rwxrwxrwx  1 alice developers  1234 Feb 25 12:34 script.sh

The first character describes if it's a

-	Regular file
d	Directory
l	Symbolic link
b	Block device file (e.g., storage devices)
c	Character device file (e.g., terminals, keyboards)
s	Socket (used for interprocess communication)
p	Named pipe (FIFO â€“ First In, First Out queue)


User (Owner) 	// The person who owns the file.
Group 			// A set of users who share the same permissions on the file.
Others (World) 	// Everyone else who is not the owner or in the group.

rwx

Read, Write, Execute

chmod - change mode // used to change the permissions for the file
